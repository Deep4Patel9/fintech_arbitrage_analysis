# fintech_arbitrage_analysis

Using Juptyer Lab and Python code to analyse arbitrage points between two Bitcoin exchanges, BitStamp and CoinBase, in the time frame of Jan-01-2018 00:00:00 to March-31-2018 23:59:00. In this project I analyze possible arbitrage location in three different 24-hour time frames one for each month in the dataset, then calculate possible profits as well as try and look for any patterns between the three arbitrage points. Though this analysis I am hoping to try and predict future arbitrage points that may occur between crypto exchanges.

The three 24-hour time frames used for the analysis:

Early  = 2018-01-27 19 : 2018-01-28 19
Middle = 2018-02-07
Late   = 2018-03-05
